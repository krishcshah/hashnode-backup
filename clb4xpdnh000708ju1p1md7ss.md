# How to make a website without learning to code?

Introduction

I've been building websites since I was a kid and I've learned a thing or two about how to do it. A few years back, my team and I built this website for our company's first blog. We didn't have any coding knowledge, but we learned as we went along and eventually got there in the end.

WordPress

WordPress is the most popular CMS in the world, and for good reason. It's easy to use, has a large community of users and developers, and has a large selection of plugins and themes that can help you build your site quickly.

If you're looking for something free (or at least cheap), WordPress is an excellent option—and if you don't mind learning how to code later on down the road, it doesn't hurt either!

Webflow

Webflow is a drag and drop website builder that lets you easily create high quality websites without having to learn how to code. It’s best suited for e-commerce, but it can also be used for blogs and other types of sites.

Webflow has an intuitive UI (user interface) that makes it easy to use and learn even if you have never built a website before. In addition, there are pre-built templates available so that users don't have to build their own site from scratch when they want one built quickly. The only downside of this tool is its learning curve; however if you're looking for something simple then Webflow might be perfect!

Squarespace

Squarespace is a website builder that works with WordPress, Joomla and other platforms to build your online presence. You can choose from a variety of templates and styles to create a beautiful website that looks great on any device.

If you don't know how to code, don't worry! Squarespace has an easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface that allows anyone to create their own website without needing any technical knowledge or experience. This means there's no need for complicated coding languages like HTML or CSS—you just need some creativity!

Squarespace also offers several different payment plans so everyone can get started on their journey towards building their dream website at an affordable price point ($9/month). If this sounds good for you, then check out our comparison tool below:

Ghost

Ghost is a blogging platform that’s easy to use, free and open source. It has all the features you need to start your blog right away. You can choose from a variety of themes or install one of their own if you want something more customised. The user interface is clean and simple so there's no learning curve when creating new posts or pages; just click on “New Post” in the top menu bar and start typing!

Ghost also makes it easy for users who want more control over how their site looks by providing them with several options for setting up their theme: plain text only (no images), image-only (with links back to original images), Jekyll embed code generator which generates HTML markup based on the contents of different files uploaded into each directory structure folder within your repository directory structure subfolder hierarchy structure hierarchy directory names directories

Shopify

Shopify is a website builder that allows you to create an e-commerce website. It’s not free, but it does offer both paid and free plans. The paid plan costs $14 per month for the first year and then goes down to $7 per month after that (for a total of $120/year).

If you’re looking to sell physical products, Shopify is a great option because your products can be stored on their platform instead of having to create an online store from scratch each time with WordPress or another CMS system.

Hire a freelancer

Hire a freelancer.

There are several ways to do this, but the most popular is Upwork and Fiverr (and Craigslist). You can also try Freelancer or PeoplePerHour if you're looking for someone who knows how to do WordPress or other related CMSs like Drupal or Joomla! Don't forget about Craigslist; it's a good place to find contractors with specific skillsets that might not be available on other sites like Upwork or Fiverr (like web development).
