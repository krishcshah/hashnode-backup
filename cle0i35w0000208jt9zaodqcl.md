Create a Business Plan

A business plan is a blueprint for your web development agency, outlining your goals, strategies, and how you plan to achieve them. It should include information about your target market, your niche, your services, your pricing structure, and your marketing plan. This will serve as a roadmap for your business, helping you stay focused and on track.
